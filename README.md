# DBANK - A Decentralized Bank

This project allows the Users to top up, withdraw, check balance, and compound interest.

## Live Demo:
https://ronaldolipata.github.io/dbank/

## To run the project

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 16` and [`dfx`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove) `>= 0.14` are installed on your system.

Run the following commands in a new, empty project directory:

```sh
dfx start --clean --background # Run dfx in the background

npm run setup # Install packages, deploy canisters, and generate type bindings

npm start # Start the development server

dfx deploy # Run when there are changes made to the backend
```

When ready, run `dfx deploy --network ic` to deploy your application to the Internet Computer.

## Tips and Tricks

- Customize your project's code style by editing the `.prettierrc` file and then running `npm run format`.
- Reduce the latency of update calls by passing the `--emulator` flag to `dfx start`.
- Install a Motoko package by running `npx ic-mops add <package-name>`. Here is a [list of available packages](https://mops.one/).
- Split your frontend and backend console output by running `npm run frontend` and `npm run backend` in separate terminals.
